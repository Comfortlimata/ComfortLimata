# 👋 Hi, I'm Comfort Limata

**Innovative. Curious. Purpose-driven.**  
Welcome to my digital space!

I’m a third-year **Information Systems and Technology** student at the **University of Lusaka**, Zambia. I build software that solves real problems for real people — especially in areas like education, retail, and business management.

## 💡 What Drives Me

Growing up in Zambia, I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can simplify complex problems — whether it's helping a small shop track stock or enabling students to learn online. I turn those ideas into real, working systems using **PHP, MySQL, JavaScript**, and clean design.
